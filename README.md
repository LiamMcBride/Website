# Journal

## Overview
This is my first non-tutorial JS project. It features an interactive journal that you can write and edit. The journal uses local browser data to store it's journal entries so don't get too attached!

## How to set up
1. Clone the repo to your local machine
1. In the file system double click the ```index.html``` file.
1. Play around with your personal journal!
1. Editing the title will allow you to write on past days.
1. To edit a previous entry click it in the nav bar and change it.
